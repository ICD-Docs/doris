# Simple Tabular Death Certificate exchange format

This is a specific format used by the [Doris Tool](https://icd.who.int/doris) as a simple tabular alternative to the [standard JSON format](json-format.md).

This format can be used as an Excel (.xlsx) file or as a comma separated text file (.csv). 

## Sample Files
You may download small sample files from here:
### Sample Excel File
- [Excel sample (.xlsx)](files/sample.xlsx)

### Sample CSV File
- [Comma separated text file sample (.csv)](files/sample.csv)

Detailed descriptions of the fields are explained below:

## Used Data types

The data types used are:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `string` | in CSV files, alphanumeric values need to be in quotation marks `"`. |
| `integer` | Numeric field, whole numbers allowed |
| `boolean` | The values allowed are `true` and `false` |
| `date` | The date field used in the certificate is using the format defined in the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime). In CSV files, the date value need to be between quotation marks `"`. |
| `durations` | Durations define the amount of intervening time in a time interval used in the certificate for the interval field. The format is defined in the [ISO_8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations). In CSV files, the duration value need to be insert between quotation marks `"`.|

Example of date:

```
    Year:
        YYYY (eg 1997)  
    Year and month:  
        YYYY-MM (eg 1997-07)  
    Complete date:  
        YYYY-MM-DD (eg 1997-07-16)  
    Complete date plus hours and minutes:  
        YYYY-MM-DDThh:mmTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20+01:00)  
    Complete date plus hours, minutes and seconds:  
        YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30+01:00)  
    Complete date plus hours, minutes, seconds and a decimal fraction of a second  
        YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.sTZD (eg 1997-07-16T19:20:30.45+01:00)
where:
     YYYY = four-digit year
     MM   = two-digit month (01=January, etc.)
     DD   = two-digit day of month (01 through 31)
     hh   = two digits of hour (00 through 23) (am/pm NOT allowed)
     mm   = two digits of minute (00 through 59)
     ss   = two digits of second (00 through 59)
     s    = one or more digits representing a decimal fraction of a second
     TZD  = time zone designator (Z or +hh:mm or -hh:mm)
```

Example of duration:

```
The duration is represented by the format P[n]Y[n]M[n]DT[n]H[n]M[n]S, P[n]W or P<date>T<time>
In these representations, the [n] is replaced by the value for each of the date and time elements that follow the [n]. Leading zeros are not required, but the maximum number of digits for each element should be agreed to by the communicating parties. The capital letters P, Y, M, W, D, T, H, M, and S are designators for each of the date and time elements and are not replaced.
where:
    P is the duration designator (for period) placed at the start of the duration representation.
    Y is the year designator that follows the value for the number of calendar years.
    M is the month designator that follows the value for the number of calendar months.
    W is the week designator that follows the value for the number of weeks.
    D is the day designator that follows the value for the number of calendar days.
    T is the time designator that precedes the time components of the representation.
    H is the hour designator that follows the value for the number of hours.
    M is the minute designator that follows the value for the number of minutes.
    S is the second designator that follows the value for the number of seconds.

To resolve ambiguity, "P1M" is a one-month duration and "PT1M" is a one-minute duration.

Practical examples:
    "PT10S" is a ten seconds duration
    "PT10M" is a ten minutes duration
    "PT10H" is a ten hours duration
    "P5D" is a five days duration
    "P2W" is a two weeks duration
    "P10M" is a ten months duration
    "P10Y" is a ten years duration
    "", "P" or "PT" is used for unknown interval.

Note: CauseOfDeath fields can be provided either as code, URI or text. we have individual columns for them. Having just one of them is necessary.
